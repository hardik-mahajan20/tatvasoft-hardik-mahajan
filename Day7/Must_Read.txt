Day 7 Task :- User Retrieval, User CRUD(05-JULY-2024)

-> In this task, I understood the concept of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Retrieval).
-> I have implemented the concept learned in the session.
-> I have added comments for convenience.
-> Admin first gets the JWT token and authorizes him/her using the "Bearer" keyword, and then only he/she can be authorized.
-> Admins have authority to create- users, read user details, update users, etc.
-> I have used Employee just for the real-time example.

Things Done :-

[1] Created Database and table for User and Admin✔️(CRUD)

[2] Created Controller for create, update, delete, add of user(MissionController.cs)

[3] Used swagger to implement and test the created Login-API✔️
