Day 5 Task :- Understand Authentication and Authorization, Role based Authorization(Admin and User roles)(04-JULY-2024)

-> In this task, I understood the core difference between authentication and authorization. 
-> Authentication is the process of determining a user's identity. 
-> Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has access to a resource.
-> I learned about the JWT token and how it is generated.
-> I have implemented the concept learned in the session.
-> I have added comments for convenience.
-> By mistake the main-folder and solution-folder name are CRUD so ignore it.
-> Admin/User first get JWT token and Authorize him/her using "Bearer" keyword and then only hi/she can authorized.
