Date : 12-July-24

-> In this session, I connected both my backend and frontend parts and tried all the APIs.
-> I joined the given Angular project to create a.NET project and tried to test all the APIs (Add, Register, etc.).
-> I have also added the Angular project to this project.
-> There is an issue with the frontend or backend; some APIs are not being hit by the frontend. I'm trying to solve this.Â 
-> I have not uploaded Angular_VCProject-main folder because its size is too large, and not supported for GitHub
